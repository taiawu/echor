\title{Calculate dilutions between mother and daughter plates}
\usage{
calculate_dilutions(daughter, mother, .echo_drop_nL = 25)
}
\arguments{
\item{daughter}{daughter plate layout, standardized for echo functions with standardize_layout()}

\item{mother}{mother plate layout, standardized for echo functions with standardize_layout()}

\item{.echo_drop_nL}{the droplet size of the Echo to be used, in nL. Defaults to 25.}
}
\value{
the input tibble, with additional columns describing the volume to be transferred from the mother, and the extent to which rounding the input concentration was necessary, given the droplet size of the echo used.
}
\description{
A helper funciton used inside of calculate_transfers() to calculate the volume of compound to transfer from mother to daughter wells.
