Description: Given the layout of a mother and daughter plate, this package creates instruction files which can be uploaded to the Plate Reformat software for Echo Acoustic Liquid Handling instruments. This allows complex, precise liquid handlign steps of experiments to be handled by Echo, rather than by hand.
